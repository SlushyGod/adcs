# TEAM ADCS

Team ADCS is a Mississippi State Snr Design project. ADCS stands for Autonomous Drone Charging Station, and as you can tell in the title, it is to autonomously charge a drone so the user does not have to be there. To read more about the project, <a href="https://design.ece.msstate.edu/2018/team_thomas/">click here!</a> Each directory contains code for a subsytem of the project and contains it's own README file explaining how to impliment the code. This is not a step by step instruction on how to build the ADCS, it is a place for the team to store and modify code.

## Getting Started - List of the directories and what they do.

Charging_Code - Contains stuff from Pebo.<br>
Main_Code - Conatins stuff from Pebo.<br>
Motor_Code - Contains stuff from Pebo.<br>
Particle_Electron - Contains stuff from Slushy.<br>
Web_Code - Contains stuff from Slushy.

### Prerequisites

The pre-reqs for most of this code is that you have to have the hardware that is given in each README(arduino, electron, etc.).

## Deployment
